<p><strong>February 2017</strong></p>
<p>In this notebook we discuss the asymptotic properties of decision rules.
After a general introduction we restrict attention to empirical loss
minimizing decision rules, establish sufficient conditions for
consistency to hold and discuss the rate at which the convergence takes
place.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Consistency of a decision rule states that the corresponding
empirical loss converges to the true loss in probability as the
sample size grows to infinity.</li>
<li>In the case of empirical loss minimization, consistency is tightly
linked to the uniform law of large numbers that we present in detail.</li>
<li>We introduce tail and concentration bounds to establish the uniform
law of large numbers and analyze the (non-asymptotic) rate at which
the convergence takes place.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Knowing the true mechanism <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, while one faces a decision problem
<span class="math">\((\mathcal{H},L,\mathcal{A})\)</span>, naturally leads to the best in
class action <span class="math">\(a^{*}_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span> as the optimal action
within the prespecified class <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>. Although in reality
we do not know <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, it is illuminating to consider this case first
as we naturally require that at least with a sufficiently large (in
fact, infinite) sample, the true mechanism&#8212;from a statistical point of
view&#8212;can be revealed. The property that guarantees this outcome is the
ergodicity of the assumed statistical models.</p>
<p>This argument suggests to use the best in class action,
<span class="math">\(a^{*}_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span>, as the optimal large sample solution.
In other words, from any sensible decision rule a minimal property to
require is that as the sample size grows, the distribution of the
decision rule converges to a degenerate distribution concentrated at the
point <span class="math">\(a^{*}_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As an example, consider again the MLE estimator in the coin tossing
problem for which the above property is satisfied. The following figure
represents how the different confidence bands associated with the
induced action distribution evolve as the sample size goes to infinity.
Apparently, for sufficiently large sample sizes, the confidence bands
concentrate around the true value, which, due to the correct
specification is equivalent to the best in class action.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="../_images/asymptotic_cointoss_consistency.png" />
</div>
<p>This property of the decision rule is called <strong>consistency</strong>. One of the
main objectives of this notebook is to investigate the conditions under
which it can be established.</p>
<p>Given that asymptotically the true <span class="math">\(P\)</span> can be learned, a natural
question to ask is why not to set <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> large enough so as
to guarantee <span class="math">\(\gamma(P)\in\mathcal{A}\)</span>, i.e. a correctly specified
model. We will see the sense in which requiring consisteny ties our
hands in terms of the &#8220;size&#8221; of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Although it is hard to provide generally applicable sufficient
conditions for consistency, roughly speaking, we can identify two big
classes of decision rules for which powerful results are available.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bayes decision rules</li>
<li>Frequentist decision rules building on the empirical distribution
<span class="math">\(P_n\)</span>, where</li>
</ul>
<div class="math">
\[P_n(z) : = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{1}\{Z_i \leq z\}\]</div>
<p>and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{1}\{ A \}\)</span> is the indicator function of the set
<span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this notebook we will focus exclusively on the latter approach
considering decision rules that assign actions by minimizing the
empirical analog of the population loss. Hence, the procedure is
labelled by the name: <strong>empirical loss minimization</strong> or <strong>analog
estimation</strong>.</p>

<div class="section" id="consistency-of-decision-rules">
<h2>Consistency of decision rules<a class="headerlink" href="#consistency-of-decision-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To start out our asymptotic inquiry, we first define consistency in a
more precise manner than we did before. There are two, slightly
different notions depending on the tractability and objectives of the
decision problem at hand.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Consistency in terms of the loss function:</strong> a decision rule
<span class="math">\(d: \mathcal{S} \mapsto \mathcal{A}\)</span> is consistent in terms of
the loss function relative to <span class="math">\((\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{A})\)</span>, if
for all <span class="math">\(P \in \mathcal{H}\)</span>,</li>
</ul>
<div class="math">
\[L(P, d(Z^n)) \ \ \underset{n \to \infty}{\overset{\text{P}}{\rightarrow}} \ \ \inf_{a \in \mathcal{A}}L(P, a) = L\left(P, a^{*}_{L, P,\mathcal{A}}\right).\]</div>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Consistency in terms of the action:</strong> a decision rule
<span class="math">\(d: \mathcal{S} \mapsto \mathcal{A}\)</span> is consistent in terms of
the action relative to <span class="math">\((\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{A})\)</span>, if for all
<span class="math">\(P \in \mathcal{H}\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">
\[m\left(d\left(Z^n\right), a^*_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\right) \ \ \underset{n \to \infty}{\overset{\text{P}}{\rightarrow}} \ \ 0.\]</div>
</li>
</ul>
<!---

P\left\{z^{\infty} \big| \lim_{n \to \infty} m\left(d(z_n), a^*_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\right) > \epsilon\right\} = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad \forall\epsilon>0,

---><p>where <span class="math">\(m(\cdot, \cdot)\)</span> is a metric on the action space
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>. The necessary condition&#8212;in the case of analog
estimators&#8212;for this notion of consistency is the identifiability of
<span class="math">\(a^*_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span> that we define as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="math">\(a^*_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span> is identified relative to <span class="math">\((P, \mathcal{A})\)</span> if <span class="math">\(a^*_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span> is the unique minimizer of <span class="math">\(L(P, \cdot)\)</span> over <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(a^*_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span> is (uniformly) identified relative to <span class="math">\((\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{A})\)</span> if it is identified relative to <span class="math">\((P, \mathcal{A})\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(P\in\mathcal{H}\)</span>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Under identification, the two notions of consistency are equivalent. As
the above definitions suggest, however, the former is more general to
the extent that it also allows for partially identified statistical
models. Unless otherwise noted, we will work with consistency in terms
of the loss function and call it simply <em>consistency</em>.</p>
<p>In the above definitions, the set of assumed statistical models
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span> plays a key role: it outlines the set of
distributions under which the particular notion of convergence is
required. Ideally, we want convergence under the true distribution,
however, because we do not know <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, the &#8220;robust&#8221; approach is to
be as agnostic as possible regarding <span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span>. The central
insight of statstical decision theory is to highlight that this approach
is not limitless: one needs to find a balance between
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> to obtain decision rules
with favorable properties.</p>
<p>Consistency has strong implications for the risk functional in large
samples: the degenerate limiting distribution of the decision rule
implies that asymptotically the variability of the decision rule
vanishes and so</p>
<div class="math">
\[R_{\infty}(P,d) := \lim_{n\to \infty} \ R_n(P, d) \overset{a.s.}{=} L\left(P, a^{*}_{L, P,\mathcal{A}}\right).\]</div>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="uniform-law-of-large-numbers">
<h2>Uniform law of large numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#uniform-law-of-large-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned before, in this notebook we are focusing on decision rules
arising from empirical loss minimization. The basic idea behind this
approach is to utilize the consistency definitions directly, but instead
of using the quantity <span class="math">\(L(P, a)\)</span> that we cannot actually evaluate,
subsitute the empirical distribution into the loss function and work
with the <strong>empricial loss</strong> <span class="math">\(L(P_n, a)\)</span> instead.</p>
<p><strong>REMARK:</strong> The empirical loss is not defined, if <span class="math">\(P_n\)</span> is not in
the domain of <span class="math">\(L\)</span>&#8212;as is the case, for example, with
non-parametric density estimation. Then, one has to either extend the
domain of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> or map <span class="math">\(P_n\)</span> to the original domain of the
loss function <span class="math">\(L\)</span>. An excellent discussion can be found in <a class="reference internal" href="#manski-1988" id="id1">[Manski-1988]</a>
.</p>
<p>Given that the loss function is continuous in its first argument, the
law of large numbers (LLN), accompanied with the continuous mapping
theorem, implies</p>
<div class="math">
\[L(P_n, a) \ \ \underset{n \to \infty}{\overset{\text{P}}{\to}} \ \ L(P, a)\]</div>
<p>that is, for a <em>fixed action</em> <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, the emprical loss converges in
probability to the true loss as the sample size goes to infinity.
Notice, however, that consistency</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>is not a property of a given action, but a whole decision rule, more
precisely, it is about the convergence of the sequence
<span class="math">\(\{d(z^n)\}_{n\geq 1} \subseteq \mathcal{A}\)</span></li>
<li>requires convergence to the <em>minimum</em> loss (within
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>) that we ought to take into account while
generating decision rules</li>
</ul>
<p>In the spirit of the analogy principle, decision rules minimizing the
<em>empirical loss</em> can be defined as follows</p>
<div class="math">
\[d(z^n) := \arg\min_{a\in\mathcal{A}} L(P_n, a), \quad\quad\quad (1)\]</div>
<p>where the dependence on the sample is embodied by the empirical
distribution <span class="math">\(P_n\)</span>. The heuristic idea is that because
<span class="math">\(d(z^n)\)</span> minimizes <span class="math">\(L(P_n, \cdot)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(P_n\)</span>
converges to <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, then &#8220;ideally&#8221; <span class="math">\(d(z^n)\)</span> should go to
<span class="math">\(a^{*}_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span>, the minimizer of <span class="math">\(L(P, a)\)</span>, as
the sample size grows to infinity.</p>
<p>What do we need to ensure this argument to hold? First, notice that the
standard law of large numbers is inadequate for this purpose. In order
to illustrate this, we turn now to a concept closely related to
empirical loss minimization: <strong>generalization</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the empirical loss as a substitute for the true loss while
determining the decision rule, a critical question is how much error do
we introduce with this approximation. The object of interest regarding
this question is the following quantity defined for a given action
<span class="math">\(a\)</span> and realization of the sample <span class="math">\(z^n\)</span></p>
<div class="math">
\[\xi(a, z^n) = \left| L(P_n, a) - L(P, a) \right|.\]</div>
<p>We say that the action <span class="math">\(a\)</span> <em>generalizes well from a given sample</em>
<span class="math">\(z^n\)</span>, if the corresponding <span class="math">\(\xi(a, z^n)\)</span> is small. Taking
the absolute value is important: <span class="math">\(L(P_n, a)\)</span> can easily be smaller
than <span class="math">\(L(P, a)\)</span> as it is in the case of overfitting.</p>
<p>Due to <span class="math">\(P_n\)</span>&#8216;s dependence on the particular sample, however, the
quantity <span class="math">\(\xi(a, \cdot)\)</span> is a random variable. It might be small
for a given sample <span class="math">\(z^n\)</span>, but what we really need in order to
justify the method of empricial loss minimization is that <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> is
small for &#8220;most samples&#8221;, or more precisely</p>
<div class="math">
\[P\left(z^n : \left| L(P_n, a) - L(P, a) \right| &gt; \delta \right) \quad \text{is small.}\]</div>
<p>Since <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is continuous in its first argument and
<span class="math">\(P_n \to P\)</span>, this so called <strong>tail probability</strong> converges to zero
for any fixed <span class="math">\(a\in\mathcal{A}\)</span>. The figure below displays such
tail probabilities for the MLE estimator in the coin tossing example
(with quadratic loss) for different actions as functions of the sample
size.</p>
<p>One can see that even though the tail probabilities converge to
<span class="math">\(0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(a\in\mathcal{A}\)</span>, the <em>rate of convergence</em>
depends on the particular <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. In other words,
<span class="math">\(\forall \varepsilon&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\forall a\in\mathcal{A}\)</span>, there
is an <em>action dependent</em> minimum sample size
<span class="math">\(N(a, \varepsilon, \delta)\)</span> (represented by the vertical solid
lines) that we need in order to guarantee that the tail probability
falls below <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="../_images/asymptotic_cointoss_tail.png" />
</div>
<p>Suppose now that we have a decision rule and look at its induced
sequence of actions <span class="math">\(\{a_n\}_{n\geq 1}\subset \mathcal{A}\)</span> for a
fixed realization <span class="math">\(z^{\infty}\)</span>. Again, for consistency, we need
the associated sequence of tail probabilities converging to zero for
&#8220;most <span class="math">\(z^{\infty}\)</span>&#8221;.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When the set <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> has finitely many elements, this is
not a problem: we can simply define</li>
</ul>
<div class="math">
\[N(\varepsilon, \delta) : = \max_{a\in\mathcal{A}} N(a, \varepsilon, \delta)\]</div>
<p>and observe that for all <span class="math">\(n\geq N(\varepsilon, \delta)\)</span>, the tail
probabilities are smaller than <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, for all
<span class="math">\(a\in \{a_n\}_{n\geq 1} \subseteq \mathcal{A}\)</span>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>However, because the critical sample size
<span class="math">\(N(a, \varepsilon, \delta)\)</span> depends on the action, if
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is &#8220;too big&#8221;, it is possible that there is no
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> so that <span class="math">\(n &gt; N(a_n, \varepsilon, \delta)\)</span>, hence
<span class="math">\(L(P_n, a_n)\)</span> may never approach <span class="math">\(L(P, a_n)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A possible approach to avoid this complication is to require the
existence of an integer <span class="math">\(N(\varepsilon, \delta)\)</span> <em>independent of</em>
<span class="math">\(a\)</span>, such that for all sample sizes larger than
<span class="math">\(N(\epsilon, \delta)\)</span></p>
<div class="math">
\[\sup_{a \in\mathcal{A}} \left| L(P_n, a) - L(P, a) \right| \ \overset{\text{P}}{\to} \ 0.\]</div>
<p>This notion is called the <strong>uniform law of large numbers</strong> referring to
the fact that the convergence is guaranteed simultaneously for all
actions in <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="a-special-case-plug-in-estimators">
<h3>A special case &#8211; plug-in estimators<a class="headerlink" href="#a-special-case-plug-in-estimators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are special cases where we do not need to worry about uniformity.
When the true loss function has a minimizer
<span class="math">\(a^{*}_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span> that admits a closed form in the sense
that it can be expressed as a continuous function of <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, the
empirical loss minimizer is simply a sample analog of
<span class="math">\(a^{*}_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span>. Effectively, there is no need to
explicitly minimize the emprical loss, so in spirit, it is as if we kept
a particular action fixed. In these cases the standard LLN is sufficient
to establish consistency.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>Sample mean:</em></p>
<p>Consider the quadratic loss function with the feature
<span class="math">\(\gamma(P) = E[Z]\)</span>, i.e. the loss is
<span class="math">\(L(P,a) = E[(a - E[Z])^2]\)</span>. Evidently, the minimizer of this
quantity is <span class="math">\(E[Z]\)</span>. Although we could proceed by minimizing the
empricial loss to derive the decision rule, we do not need to do
that, because we know up front that it is equal to the sample analog
of <span class="math">\(E[Z]\)</span>. The decision rule is the plug-in estimator
<span class="math">\(d(z^n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}z_i\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>OLS estimator:</em></p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math">\(Z=(Y, X)\)</span> and consider the quadratic loss
<span class="math">\(L(P, a) = E[(Y-a)^2 | X]\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(E[\cdot | X]\)</span> is the
expectation operator conditioned on <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. Assume that
<span class="math">\((Y, X)\)</span> follows a multivariate normal distribution, then the
minimizer of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is given by
<span class="math">\(a = E\left[(X'X)^{-1}\right]E[X'Y]\)</span>. Consequently, there is no
need for explicit minimization, we can use the least squares
estimator as a plug-in estimator for <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, as the empirical loss minimizer is itself a functional,
if the <span class="math">\(\min\)</span> functional can be shown to be continuous on the
space of empirical loss functions, i.e. the functional</p>
<div class="math">
\[f : L(P_n, \cdot) \mapsto \mathbb{R}, \quad \text{s.t.}\quad\quad f(P_n) = \min_{a\in\mathcal{A}} \ L(P_n, a)\]</div>
<p>is continuous, then an application of the continuous mapping theorem
together with the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem (i.e.
<span class="math">\(\lVert P_n - P \rVert_{\infty} \to 0\)</span>) would yield consistency.

<h2>Uniform law of large numbers and consistency<a class="headerlink" href="#uniform-law-of-large-numbers-and-consistency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In more general nonlinear models, however,
<span class="math">\(a^{*}_{L, P, \mathcal{A}}\)</span> has no analytical form, so we cannot
avoid minimizing the empirical loss in order to derive the decision
rule. In these cases, guaranteeing the validity of uniform convergence
becomes essential. In fact, it can be shown that consistency of any
decision rule that we derive by minimizing some empirical loss function,
is <em>equivalent with</em> the uniform LLN.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="#vapnik-chervonenkis-1971" id="id3">[Vapnik-Chervonenkis-1971]</a>: Uniform
convergence</p>
<div class="math">
\[\lim_{n\to \infty} P\left\{\sup_{a \in\mathcal{A}} \left| L(P_n, a) - L(P, a) \right| &lt; \varepsilon\right\}= 1\]</div>
<p>for all <span class="math">\(\varepsilon &gt;0\)</span> is <em>necessary and sufficient</em> for
consistency of decision rules arising from empirical loss minimization
over <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Although this characterization of consistency is theoretically
intriguing, it is not all that useful in practice unless we find
easy-to-check conditions which ensure uniform convergence of empirical
loss over a particular function class <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>. As a
preparation to discuss these conditions, introduce first some notation</p>
<p>Almost all loss functions used in practice can be cast in the following
form. There exist</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(l : \mathcal{A}\times \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{m}\)</span> and</li>
<li>a <em>continuous</em> <span class="math">\(r : \mathbb{R}^{m} \mapsto \mathbb{R}_+\)</span> such
that</li>
</ul>
<div class="math">
\[L(P, a) = r\left( \int_Z l(a, z)dP (z)\right).\]</div>
<p>Continuity of <span class="math">\(r\)</span> implies that in order to establish consistency
it is enough to investigate the properties of the limit</p>
<div class="math">
\[\sup_{a\in\mathcal{A}} \left| \int_Z l(a, z)dP_n (z) - \int_Z l(a, z)dP(z)\right|  \ \  \overset{\text{P}}{\to} \ \  0 .\]</div>
<p>Formally, this requires that the class of functions
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}:= \left\{l(a, \cdot) : a \in \mathcal{A} \right\}\)</span>
is a <strong>Glivenko-Cantelli class</strong> for <span class="math">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>Definition (Glivenko-Cantelli class):</strong> Let <span class="math">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> be a
class of integrable real-valued functions of the random variable
<span class="math">\(Z\)</span> having distribution <span class="math">\(P\)</span>. Consider the random variable</p>
<div class="math">
\[\Vert P_n - P \Vert_{\mathcal{G}} : = \sup_{g\in\mathcal{G}} \left| P_n g - Pg \right|\]</div>
<p>We say that <span class="math">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> is a Glivenko-Cantelli class for
<span class="math">\(P\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(\Vert P_n - P \Vert_{\mathcal{G}}\)</span> converges to
zero in probability as <span class="math">\(n\to\infty\)</span>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The usefulness of this formulation comes from the fact that it allows us
to bring to bear powerful techniques from empirical process theory
<a class="reference internal" href="#pollard-1984" id="id4">[Pollard-1984]</a>. This is because the random variable</p>
<div class="math">
\[\left| \int_Z l(a, z)dP_n (z) - \int_Z l(a, z)dP(z)\right|\]</div>
<p>can be considered as an <strong>empirical process</strong> indexed by the function
class <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}\)</span>. For each action <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, let
<span class="math">\(l_a:=l(a, \cdot)\)</span> and note that <span class="math">\(l_a\)</span> is a function of the
random variable <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>. Using typical notation of the empirical
process literature, we can rewrite the above absolute difference as</p>
<div class="math">

<p>Notice that <span class="math">\(P_n l_a\)</span> is a random variable because the empirical
distribution is a function of the random sample, while <span class="math">\(Pl_a\)</span> is
just the expectation of <span class="math">\(l_a\)</span> and so it is a non-random scalar.</p>

A useful decomposition highlights the importance of the uniform law of large numbers in the case of empirical loss minimization. We would like to know the difference between the true loss of our estimator and the true loss of the best in class action. For a given sample $z^n$ denote the analog estimate as $\hat{a} = d(z^n)$ and the best in class action as $a^*$.

$$ Pl_{\hat{a}} - Pl_{a^*} = (Pl_{\hat{a}} - P_n l_{\hat{a}}) + (P_n l_{\hat{a}} - P_n l_{a^*})  + (P_n l_{a^*} - P l_{a^*}) $$

The last term on the right hand side is governed by the Law of Large Numbers, the middle term is necessarily weakly positive by definition of the empirical loss minimizing decision rule, and the first term is governed by the Uniform Law of Large Numbers. Hence, if we want to control the excess risk -- the left hand side -- then we necessarily have to control the right hand side.

<h3>Sufficient conditions for ULLN<a class="headerlink" href="#sufficient-conditions-for-ulln" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Variables of the form <span class="math">\(\Vert P_n - P \Vert_{\mathcal{G}}\)</span> are
ubiquitos in statistics and econometrics and there are well-known
sufficient conditions that guarantee its convergence.</p>
<p>For parametric estimation, probably the most widely used (at least in
econometrics) sufficient condition includes the following three
assumptions (or some form thereof). Suppose that the action space
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is indexed by a finite dimensional vector
<span class="math">\(\theta\in\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^{p}\)</span>. If</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math">\(\Theta\)</span> is <em>compact</em></li>
<li><span class="math">\(l(\theta, z)\)</span> is a function such that <span class="math">\(l(\cdot, z)\)</span> is
<em>continuous</em> on <span class="math">\(\Theta\)</span> with probability one</li>
<li><span class="math">\(l(\theta, z)\)</span> is <em>dominated</em> by a function <span class="math">\(B(z)\)</span>, i.e.
<span class="math">\(|l(\theta, z)|\leq B(z)\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(\theta\in\Theta\)</span>, such
that <span class="math">\(\mathbb{E}[B(Z)]&lt;\infty\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>then
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}} := \left\{l(a, \cdot) : a \in \mathcal{A} \right\}\)</span>
is a Glivenko-Cantelli class for <span class="math">\(P\)</span> and so the estimator that it
represents is consistent. Among others, these assumptions are the bases
for consistency of the (Quasi-)Maximum Likelihood <a class="reference internal" href="#white-1994" id="id5">[White-1994]</a> and the Generalized Method of Moments estimators
<a class="reference internal" href="#hansen-1982" id="id6">[Hansen-1982]</a>.</p>
<p>A somewhat different approach focuses on the &#8220;effective size&#8221; of the
class <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}\)</span> and frames sufficient conditions
in terms of particular complexity measures such as the <em>Rademacher
complexity</em>, <em>Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension</em>, <em>covering/packing
numbers</em>, etc. The idea is to find tail bounds for the probability that
<span class="math">\(\Vert P_n - P \Vert_{\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}}\)</span> deviates
substantially above the complexity of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}\)</span>.
In the following section we present the main ideas behind the derivation
of non-asymptotic tail bounds.</p>
<p><strong>An interesting necessary condition:</strong> If
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}\)</span> is a collection of indicator functions
and the data generating process is assumed to be i.i.d., a <em>necessary</em>

that the Vapnik-Chervonenkis complexity of

<h2>Non-asymptotic bounds<a class="headerlink" href="#non-asymptotic-bounds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we have seen above, one way to establish consistency for analog
estimators is to require uniform convergence of the empirical loss to
the true loss over the entire action space, i.e. guarantee that the
uniform law of large numbers holds. This section presents an approach to
the laws of large numbers (uniform or &#8220;standard&#8221;) building on a finite
sample perspective.</p>
<p>We study the concentration of centered averages around their means for
different finite sample sizes. More generally, we want results of the
form</p>
<div class="math">
\[P\left(z^n \ : \ \left|g(z^n) - E[g(z^n)]\right| \geq \delta_n\right) \leq \varepsilon\quad\text{with}\quad\delta_n \to 0\]</div>
<p>OR</p>
<div class="math">
\[P\left( z^n \ : \ \left|g(z^n) - E[g(z^n)]\right| \geq \delta\right) \leq \varepsilon_n\quad\text{with}\quad\varepsilon_n \to 0\]</div>
<p>Such results are known as <strong>concentration inequalities</strong>. Ensuring that
the centered average goes to a degenerate distribution on its
mean&#8212;&#8221;perfectly&#8221; concentrates around it&#8212;establishes the law of large
numbers. Moreover, studying concentration and tail bounds has the
advantage that we obtain approximate rates of convergence as a
byproduct. These rates of convergence will give us information regarding
the minimum sample size above which generalization from the empricial
loss to the true loss is justified.</p>
<p>First, we study how the concentration inequalities work for a single
random variable. This is going to parallel the law of large numbers.
Second, we study concentration inequalities applicable uniformly over a
class of random variables, i.e. <em>uniform bounds</em> of the form</p>
<div class="math">
\[P\left(z^n \ : \ \sup_{g\in\mathcal{G}} \ \left|g(z^n) - E[g(z^n)]\right| \geq \delta_n\right) \leq \varepsilon\quad\text{with}\quad\delta_n \to 0\]</div>
<p>over a class of functions <span class="math">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span>. This is going to parallel
the uniform law of large numbers. For ease of notation we present the
results for a general class of measurable functions
<span class="math">\(g \in \mathcal{G}\)</span> &#8211; but remember that in almost all
applications we will substitute it for
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This section builds on the material in <a class="reference internal" href="#wasserman-2016" id="id7">[Wasserman-2016]</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#bousquet-2004" id="id8">[Bousquet-2004]</a>.</p>
<!---
Throughout this section we should keep in mind the characterization of consistency in the case of analog estimators. This was equivalent to uniform convergence which we repeat here

$$ P\left( \sup_{a\in\mathcal{A}} \left| \int_Z l(a, z)dP_n (z) - \int_Z l(a, z)dP(z)\right| > \varepsilon \right) \quad  \underset{n \to \infty}{\to} \quad  0 \quad\quad \forall \varepsilon > 0. $$

For each action the loss is a just a (measurable) function of the random variable $Z$, $l_a(Z):=l(a, Z)$.

<p>For obtaining bounds of moment generating functions, a particularly
important class of random variables are the so called <strong>sub-Gaussian
variables</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A random variable <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> is called sub-Gaussian if
there is a positive number <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> such that for all
<span class="math">\(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\)</span></p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\lambda \left(Z - \mathbb{E}[Z] \right)} \right] \leq e^{\sigma^2\lambda^2/2}\]</div>
<p><strong>REMARK:</strong>: A Guassian variable with variance <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is
sub-Gaussian with parameter <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>. There are other non-Guassian
random variables which are sub-Gaussian &#8211; for example all bounded
random variables.</p>
<p>The property of sub-Gaussianity is preserved by linear operations, which
leads to the following important result</p>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> (Hoeffding) Let the variables <span class="math">\(g(Z_i)\)</span> be iid and
sub-Gaussian with parameter <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>. Then, for all <span class="math">\(t&gt;0\)</span> we
have that</p>
<div class="math">
\[P\left\{\left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n g(Z_i) - \mathbb{E}[g(Z)]\right| \geq t\right\} \leq 2\exp\left\{-\frac{t^2 n}{2\sigma^2}\right\}.\]</div>
<p>For a single random variable <span class="math">\(g(Z)\)</span>, we see how the Hoeffding
inequality is at the core of the law of large numbers. As <span class="math">\(n\)</span> goes
to infinity, the upper bound on the right goes to zero implying that the
probability on the left must go to zero as well <em>for all</em> <span class="math">\(P\)</span> that
makes <span class="math">\(g(Z)\)</span> sub-Gaussian. In fact, further inspection reveals
that the upper bound also provides an exponential rate of convergence:
<span class="math">\(t^2/(2\sigma^2)\)</span></p>
<p>However, in order to talk about concentration properties of decision
rules, <span class="math">\(d: \mathcal{S}\mapsto\mathcal{A}\)</span> we need bounds for tail
probabilities applicable uniformly over the whole action space or
alternatively, uniformly across <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}\)</span>. This

<h2>Uniform Tail and Concentration Bounds for classes of finite cardinality<a class="headerlink" href="#uniform-tail-and-concentration-bounds-for-classes-of-finite-cardinality" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a first simple example we consider uniform tail bounds over sets of
finite cardinality. Let
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{G} = \{g_j : j = 1, \ldots, J\}\)</span>. A conservative
estimate of the uniform tail bound in this case is the union bound.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary.</strong> (Hoeffding union bound) Let the variables

<p>The difference between the uniform and individual Hoeffding bounds is

<span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}\)</span> has finite cardinality. Our objective,
however, is to extend the above analysis to action spaces with infinite
cardinality. To this end, we need to find a better &#8220;measure&#8221; of the size

<h2>Uniform tail bounds for classes of infinite cardinality - Rademacher complexity<a class="headerlink" href="#uniform-tail-bounds-for-classes-of-infinite-cardinality-rademacher-complexity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to work with sets of infinitely many functions we would like to
capture the size of these infinite sets for the purpose of statistical
analysis. One such measure of statistical size is the Rademacher
complexity of a class of real-valued functions.</p>
<p>For a given realization of a sample, <span class="math">\(z^n\)</span>, of size <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
consider the the set of vectors</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathcal{G}(z^n) := \left\{ (g(z_1), \ldots, g(z_n)) \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid g \in \mathcal{G} \right\}.\]</div>
<p>This embodies the number of ways one can label points of a sample using
functions in the class <span class="math">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span>. It is often called the
projection of the function class <span class="math">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> to the sample
<span class="math">\(z^n\)</span>. The <strong>empirical Rademacher complexity of</strong>
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> for fixed <span class="math">\(z^n\)</span> is defined as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathsf{R} \left(\mathcal{G}(z^n) \right) := \mathbb{E}_{\epsilon}\left[\sup_{g\in \mathcal{G}}\Big| \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i g(z_i) \Big| \right],\]</div>

<p>The <strong>Rademacher complexity of</strong> <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> for sample size

\[\mathsf{R}\left(\mathcal{G}, n\right) := \mathbb{E}_{Z^n} \Big[\mathsf{R}\left(\mathcal{G}(z^n) \right)\Big].\]</div>
<p>where the expectations is taken with respect to the sample. Rademacher
complexity has an intuitive interpretation. It is the average (across

<span class="math">\(\big(\epsilon_1, \ldots, \epsilon_n\big)_{z^n}\)</span>. The function
class <span class="math">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> is too &#8220;large&#8221; (complex) for statistical
purposes, if we can always choose a function, <span class="math">\(g\in\mathcal{G}\)</span>
that has high correlation with a randomly drawn noise vector, that is,
when the corresponding Rademacher complexity does not go to zero as the

<h3>Illustration of Rademacher complexity<a class="headerlink" href="#illustration-of-rademacher-complexity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the following we consider two examples. Although both examples use a
function class that can be parametrized by a <em>single</em> free parameter, we
will see that one of them has drastically smaller Rademacher complexity
than the other.</p>
<p><strong>Coin tossing example revisited</strong></p>
<p>Consider again the coin tossing example with the quadratic loss function
discussed before. In this case <span class="math">\(Z^n\)</span> is an iid sample from a
Binomial distribution parametrized with <span class="math">\(\theta\in[0, 1]\)</span>. The
class of functions is given by the quadratic class</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}} := \{l(a, \cdot) : l(a, z) = (z - a)^2, \ \  a \in [0, 1]\subseteq \mathbb{R}\}.\]</div>
<p>The following figure depicts the empricial Rademacher complexity
<span class="math">\(\mathsf{R} \left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}(z^n) \right)\)</span> along
alternative sample paths (on the left) and the Rademacher complexity
<span class="math">\(\mathsf{R}\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}, n\right)\)</span> for
different sample sizes (on the right).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Clearly, both
<span class="math">\(\mathsf{R} \left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}(z^n) \right)\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\mathsf{R}\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}, n\right)\)</span> converge
to zero as the sample size grows to infinity.</li>
<li>Rademacher complexity is nearly indistinguishable from Empirical
Rademacher complexity and in fact, the latter does not show much
variation across the different samples <span class="math">\(z^n\)</span> (several lines lie
on top of each other). This suggests that in the simple example of
coin tossing, the different ensemble samples (with more than 300 data
points) encode very similar information about the complexity of the
function class used in the estimation.</li>

<p><strong>Sinusoid classification</strong></p>
<p>Consider next a classification problem, where the observable is
<span class="math">\(Z=(Y, X)\)</span> and assume that the binary random variable
<span class="math">\(Y\)</span>&#8211;taking values from <span class="math">\(\{-1, 1\}\)</span>&#8211;depends on the
covariate <span class="math">\(X\)</span> in some way. Suppose that a statistician uses the
following classifiers to cature this dependence</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}} := \Big\{ \mathbb{1}\{\sin(ax) \geq 0\} - \mathbb{1}\{\sin(ax) &lt; 0\} : a \in \mathbb{R}_+ \Big\}.\]</div>
<p>That is, the classifier boundary is given by sine functions,
<span class="math">\(\sin(aX)\)</span>, parametrized by the frequency <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. For a given
<span class="math">\(a\)</span>, one can determine the range of covariate values for which
this classifier assigns the value <span class="math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>. As a result,
choosing <span class="math">\(a\in\mathcal{A}\)</span> is equivalent with choosing particular
subsets of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. To determine the optimal <span class="math">\(a\)</span> we use the
<span class="math">\(0/1\)</span> loss.</p>
<p>The following figure represents the empirical loss minimizing
classifiers for two random samples (depicted by the red dots) with
different sizes. In order to have a closed form solution for the optimal
classifier we are selecting the sample at convenient points. This is
without loss of generality and useful for illustrative purposes. The
shaded area indicates the ranges of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, where the classifier
assigns <span class="math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As we can see, by choosing a sufficiently high frequency <span class="math">\(a\)</span> we
can always find a curve which classifies the data perfectly, i.e. the
in-sample predicitions are always &#8220;correct&#8221;.</li>
<li>For better illustration, consider the empirical Rademacher complexity
associated with the sample, <span class="math">\(z^n\)</span>, depicted by the red dots.
Since <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{A}}\)</span> is always able to perfectly
separate the sample, the (empirical) Rademacher complexity always
takes its maximum value (one) irrespective of the sample size.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="../_images/asymptotic_rademacher_sinusoid.png" />
</div>
<p>Consequently, for statistical purposes the family of sine curves is too
complex. This example highlights that for general non-linear functions
the number of free parameters&#8212;here only one&#8212;does not correspond to
the complexity of the function class&#8212;which is infinity.</p>

<p>It is apparent from the above inequalities that the tightness of the
finite sample uniform bounds will be (partly) determined by the
Rademacher complexity. The change in Rademacher complexity as the sample

<span class="math">\(\Vert P_n - P \Vert_{\mathcal{G}} \to 0\)</span> or put it differently,
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> is a Glivenko-Cantelli class.</p>
<p>Notice that the second bound in <span class="math">\((**)\)</span> is data dependent in the
sense that it includes only variables that in principle, we can

<h4>Illustration of the tail bounds in the coin tossing example<a class="headerlink" href="#illustration-of-the-tail-bounds-in-the-coin-tossing-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An alternative way to express the uniform bounds is to specify a fixed
tail probability <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> and use the change of variable
<span class="math">\(\varepsilon = 2 \exp\left(- \frac{2 n \eta^2}{B^2}\right)\)</span> to
obtain</p>
<div class="math">
\[P \left\{ \Vert P_n - P \Vert_{\mathcal{G}} \geq  2\mathsf{R}\left(\mathcal{G}, n\right) + \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{2n}\log\left(\frac{2}{\varepsilon}\right)} \right\} \leq \varepsilon.\]</div>
<p>This formulation of the bound is useful because it makes transparent the
sense in which it is uniform over the action space <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>.
Similarly, for fixed action <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, we can compute the sequence
<span class="math">\(\{\delta_n(a)\}_{n\geq 1}\)</span> that makes the following expression
true for all <span class="math">\(n\)</span></p>
<div class="math">
\[P \left\{ \left| L(P_n, a) - L(P, a)\right| \geq  \delta_n(a) \right\} \leq \varepsilon.\]</div>
<p>Note that conceptually this is the same exercise that we did for tail
probabilities above. The difference is that while there we fixed
<span class="math">\(\delta_n=\delta\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and treated
<span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> (tail probability) as sample size dependent, here,
we are switching the roles and investigating the implied
<span class="math">\(n\)</span>-dependent bounds for fixed tail probability
<span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>.</p>
<p>The left panel of the following figure compares the uniform bound
derived from Rademacher complexity along with the
<span class="math">\(\{\delta_n(a)\}\)</span> sequences for different actions <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in the
coin-tossing example.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The bound expressed in terms of Rademacher complexity clearly
dominates the absolute difference between the empirical and true loss
for all actions.</li>
<li>We can see the sense in which the tail bound represents a
<em>worst-case</em> viewpoint: by bounding the <em>supremum</em> of the difference
between the empirical and true loss, one can be sure that
generalization works uniformly well over the action space, but the
bound is loose for most actions.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="../_images/rademacher_tail_bound.png" />
</div>
<p>Calculation of the Rademacher complexity in <span class="math">\((*)\)</span> requires the
knowledge of the true distribution. In this sense, inequality
<span class="math">\((**)\)</span> provides a practically more useful bound. As we have seen
above, this inequality incorporates the Empirical Rademacher complexity
and uses a looser scaling factor in the upper bound. On the other hand,
this bound is <em>agnostic</em> in the sense that it is applicable for any true
distribution <span class="math">\(\theta\in[0,1]\)</span>, i.e. for any statistical model in
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span>. The right panel of the above figure demonstrates
this fact.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For fixed <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, different <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> distributions induce
different tail probabilities. The bound constructed from the
Empirical Rademacher complexity works uniformly for all of such
alternative true probabilities.</li>
<li>One might consider this bound as a result of a <em>worst-case</em> analysis
taking into account both the action space <span class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> and the
class of statistical models <span class="math">\(\mathcal{H}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bounding expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#bounding-expectations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Related strongly to the above tail bounds, one can also bound the
<em>expectation</em> of the supremum of an empirical process using Rademacher
complexity. This is often called <strong>symmetrization inequality</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> For any class of <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-integrable functon class
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span>, we have that</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathbb{E}_{Z^n}\Big[\Vert P_n - P \Vert_{\mathcal{G}} \Big] \leq 2\mathsf{R}\left(\mathcal{G}, n\right) = 2 \mathbb{E}_{Z^n}\Big[\mathsf{R} \left(\mathcal{G}(z^n) \right)\Big].\]</div>
<p>Unfortunately, computing the Rademacher complexity directly is only
feasible in special cases (see one example below). There are various
techniques however, which give bounds on the Rademacher complexity. For
different classes of functions different techniques prove to be useful,
so one usually proceeds on a case-by-case basis. The most common ways of
bounding the Rademacher complexity are via the <strong>Vapnik-Chervonenkis
dimension</strong> for binary functions and via <strong>metric entropy</strong> for bounded
real valued functions.</p>
