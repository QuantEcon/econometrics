One might call this value \"asymptotic risk\". Being dependent on the action space $\\mathcal A$, however, this asymptotic risk is not necessarily zero. The global minimum of the loss function relates to the true feature of the DGP that we denoted by $\\gamma(P)=a^*_{L, P, \\mathcal{F}}$, with $\\mathcal{F}$ being the set of all admissible actions.  \n",

    "To clarify why the estimation error might increase in the size of the action space, we study a slightly finer decomposition of excess risk bringing the \"standard\" bias-variance trade-off to bear. The starting point of this decomposition is the observation that by assigning members of $\\mathcal A$ to *random* samples $z^n$ the decision rule $d$ effectively induces a random variable on the action space. Having said that, for each sample size $n$, we can define the *mean action* $\\bar d_n$ by taking the expected value of $d(z^n)\\in\\mathcal A$ across the different ensemble samples:\n",

It captures how sensitive is the chosen action to small variations in the realized sample. Given this interpretation, it is relatively straightforward to see the volatility term's close connection with Rademacher complexity. Remember, the Rademacher complexity of a function class essentially captures the maximal pairwise correlation between elements of the class and independent random noise. Large Rademacher complexity implies that the function class can fit any random noise and hence we expect the chosen element to be highly volatile.\n",

Notice, however, that there is a key difference between these two terms.

    "In econometrics, classical approaches to estimation build heavily on the empirical loss minimization principle, or as they often put it the *analogy principle*. The underlying justification behind this approach--that for simplicity we will call *classical*--is the *belief* that the decision rule's induced finite sample distributions converge so fast (with the sample size) that we can approximate them well with their limiting distribution. For example, in lecture {asymptotic}, while discussing the induced action distribution of the MLE estimator in the coin tossing example, we saw that the estimator's distribution did not change significantly after the sample size of 1,000. It has been stressed several times before, this property of the decision rule depends crucially on the complexity of the composite function class $\\mathcal L_{\\mathcal A}$.\n",

Instead, the classical approach often restricts attention to unbiased estimators and looks for the minimum variance estimator *among this class* (efficiency).
