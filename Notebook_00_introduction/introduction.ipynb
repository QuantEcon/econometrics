    "\n",
    "Notebook-01 presents the key objects and concepts of econometrics and statistics within the framework of statistical decision theory. We find the framework useful for organizing our thoughts and comparing different approaches to similar statistical problems thus highlighting the key differences and similarities. We do not take the framework as a starting point strictly defining optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduced framework lets us separate assumptions into three major groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Assumptions on **statistical models** describing the data generating process. Typically,  we these assumption serve as an anchor defining a class of distirbutions relative to which we would like to establish certain properties. An estimator can be consistent or unbiased relative to one set of distributions but not relative to another.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> Assumptions on the **action space** restrict the set from which we allow a decision rule to take values from. As we will see, one of the key tools to control for certain statistical properties of decision rules is through controlling the action space. \n",
    "    \n",
    "> Assumptions on the **loss function** define which aspect of the data generating process we are targeting and the specify the manner in which we punish different approximations to this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook-01 then presents statistical decision rules and characterizes them through the distributions they induce on the action space and the reals through the loss function. We set the **risk** of a decision rule as the benchmark for comparison.\n",

    "Notebook-02 takes an asymptotic approach to analyze decision rules. We discuss conditions under which **consistency** holds and see what are determinants of the **rate of convergence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this end Notebook-02 covers the basics of **concentration inequalities**. We make connections between these inequalities and measures of complexity with a special emphasis on empirical processes. We introduce the concept of **Rademacher-complexity** and Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension to capture the size of a function class for the purpose of statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out the introduced concepts provide deep insights about the asymptotic behavior of decision rules. Both consistency and the rate of convergence crucially depends on the complexity of the action space."

    "The notebook discusses two approaches to estimation and the corresponding philosphies underlying them. One is a frequentist approach labelled as **classical** which is more common in the econometrics literature. The other which we label as the approach of **statistical learning theory** underlies many of the techniques common in modern statistics.\n"
