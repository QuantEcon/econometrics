Although in reality we do not know $P$, it is illuminating to consider this case first as we naturally require that at least with a sufficiently large (in fact, infinite) sample, the true mechanism---from a statistical point of view---can be revealed. The property that guarantees this outcome is the ergodicity of the assumed statistical models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This argument suggests to use the best in class action, $a^{*}_{L, P, \\mathcal{A}}$, as the optimal large sample solution. In other words, from any sensible decision rule a minimal property to require is that as the sample size grows, the distribution of the decision rule converges to a degenerate distribution concentrated at the point $a^{*}_{L, P, \\mathcal{A}}$. \n",

The following figure represents how the different confidence bands associated with the induced action distribution evolve as the sample size goes to infinity. Apparently, for sufficiently large sample sizes, the confidence bands concentrate around the true value, which, due to the correct specification is equivalent to the best in class action.\n",
