    "### Stationarity and statistical models \n",
    "\n",
    "We model data as a partial realization of a stochastic process $Z^{\\infty}$ taking values in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Denote a particular realization as $z^{\\infty} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k\\mathbb{Z}}$ and let the partial history $z^{n}$ containing $n$ consecutive elements of the realization be the *sample* of size $n$. We assume that there exists a core mechanism undelying this process that describes the relationship among the elements of the vector $Z$. Our aim is to draw inference about this mechanism after observing a single partial realization $z^{n}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "How is this possible without being able to draw different samples under the exact same conditions? Following the exposition of [Breiman (1969)](#breiman1969) a fruitful approach is to assume that the underlying mechanism is time invariant with the stochastic process being strictly stationary and study its statistical properties by taking long-run time averages of the realization $z^{\\infty}$ (or functions thereof), e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t = 1}^{n} z_t\\quad\\quad \\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t = 1}^{n} z^2_t\\quad\\quad \\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t = k}^{n+k} z_{t}z_{t-k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the mechanism is assumed to be stable over time, it does not matter when we start observing the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, however, that strictly speaking these time averages are properties of the particular realization, the extent to which they can be generalized to the mechanism itself is not obvious. To address this question, it is illuminating to bundle realizations that share certain statistical properties together in order to construct a universe of (counterfactual) alternative $z^{\\infty}$-s, the so called *ensemble*. Statistical properties of the data generating mechanism can be summarized by assigning probabilities to (sets of) these $z^{\\infty}$-s in an internally consistent manner. These considerations lead to the idea of statistical models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical models** are probability distributions over sequences $z^{\\infty}$ that assign probabilities so that the unconditional moments are consistent with the associated long-run time averages. In other words, with statistical models the time series and ensemble averages coincide, which is the property known as **ergodicity**. Roughly speaking, ergodicity allows us to learn about the ensemble dimension by using a *single* realization $z^{\\infty}$."

    "### Dependence\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, being endowed only with a partial history of $z^{\\infty}$, we cannot calculate the exact log-run time averages. By imposing more structure on the problem and having a sufficiently large sample, however, we can obtain reasonable approximations. To this end, we need to assume some form of weak independence (\"mixing\"), or more precisely, the property that on average, the dependence between the elements of $\\{Z_t\\}_{t\\in\\mathbb{Z}}$ dies out as we increase the gap between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, if we observe a *long* segment of $z^{\\infty}$ and cut it up into shorter consecutive pieces, say of length $l$, then, we might consider these pieces (provided that $l$ is \"large enough\") as nearly independent records from the distribution of the $l$-block, $Z^l$. To clarify this point, consider a statistical model $Q_{Z^{\\infty}}$ (joint distribution over sequences $z^{\\infty}$) with density function $q_{z^{\\infty}}$ and denote the implied density of the sample as $q_{n}$. Note that because of strict stationarity, it is enough to use the number of consecutive elements as indices. Under general regularity conditions we can decompose this density as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q_{n}\\left(z^n\\right) = q_{n-1}\\left(z_n | z^{n-1}\\right)q_{n-1}\\left(z^{n-1}\\right) = q_{n-1}\\left(z_n | z^{n-1}\\right)q_{n-2}\\left(z_{n-1}|z^{n-2}\\right)\\dots q_{1}\\left(z_{2}|z_1\\right)q_{1}\\left(z_1\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we assume that the stochastic process is Markov so that the partial histories $z^{i}$ for $i=1,\\dots, n-1$ in the conditioning sets can be replaced by the \"right\" number of lags $z^{n-1}_{n-l}$ and we can drop the subindex from the conditional densties\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q_{n}(z^n) = q(z_n | z^{n-1}_{n-1-l})q(z_{n-1}|z^{n-2}_{n-2-l})\\dots q(z_{l+1}|z_{1}^{l})q_{l}(z^l) \\quad\\quad\\quad (1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption is much stronger than what we really need. First, it suffices to require the existence of a history-dependent latent state variable similar to the Kalman filter. Moreover, we could also relax the Markov assumption and allow for dependence that dies out only asymptotically. In practice, however, we often have a stong view about the dependency structure, or at least we are willing to use economic theory to guide our choice of $l$. In these cases we almost always assume a Markovian structure. For simplicity, in these lectures, unless otherwise stated, we will restrict ourselves to the family of Markov processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption allows us to learn about the underlying mechanism $Q_{Z^{\\infty}}$ via its $l+1$-period building blocks. Once we determine the (ensemble) distribution of the block, $Q_{Z^{[l+1]}}$, we can \"build up\" $Q_{Z^{\\infty}}$ from these blocks by using a formula similar to (1). Having said that the block distribution $Q_{Z^{[l+1]}}$ carries the same information as $Q_{Z^{\\infty}}$. Therefore, from now on, we define $Z$ as the minimal block we need to know and treat it as an **observation**. Statistical models can be represented by their predictions about the ensemble distribution $P$ of this observable. \n",

    "### True data generating process\n",

Naturally, in such cases properties of the loss function become crucial by specifying the nature of punishments used to weight deviations from $\\gamma(P)$. We will talk more about misspecification in the following sections. A couple of examples should help clarifying the introduced concepts.\n",

    "In the above examples we maintained the assumption of correctly specified models, i.e., the true feature of the data generating process lied within the action set $\\mathcal{A}$. In applications using nonexperimental data, however, it is more reasonable to assume that the action set contains only approximations of the true feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing in the analysis above prevents us from entertaining the possibility of misspecification. In these instances one can look at $a^{*}_{L, P, \\mathcal{A}}$ as the best approximation of $\\gamma(P)$ achievable by the model specification $\\mathcal{A}$. For example, even though the true regression function (conditional expectation) might not be linear, the exercise of estimating the *best linear approximation* of the regression function is well defined. \n",

    "$$\\min_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}} \\ L(P,a) - L(P, \\gamma(P))$$\n",

    "This naturally leads to a dilemma regarding the \"size\" of the action space: with a richer $\\mathcal{A}$, in principle, we can get closer to the true feature by making the misspecification error small. Notice, however, that in practice, not knowing $P$ implies that we cannot solve the above optimization problem and obtain the best-in-class action. As we show in notebook2 {REF}, a possible way to proceed is to require the so called *consistency* property from our decision rule by which we can guarantee to get very close to $a^{*}_{L, P, \\mathcal{A}}$ with *sufficiently large* samples, however, what \"sufficently large\" means will be determined by the size of our $\\mathcal{A}$. Larger action spaces will require larger samples to get sensible estimates for the best-in-class action. In fact, by using a \"too large\" $\\mathcal{A}$ accompanied with a \"too small\" sample, our estimator's performance can be so bad that misspecification concerns become secondary. \n",

    "In other words, finiteness of the sample gives rise to a trade-off between the severity of misspecifiation and the credibility of our estimates.

    "\n",
    "While the estimation error stems from the fact that we do not know $P$, so we have to use a finite sample to approximate the best-in-class action, misspecification error, not influenced by any random object, arises from the necessity of $\\mathcal{A}\\subsetneq\\mathcal{F}$. \n",

    "This trade-off resembles the bias-variance dilemma well-known from classical statistics. Statisticians often connect the estimation error with the decision rule's variance, whereas the misspecification error is considered as the bias term. We will see in notebook3 {REF} that this interpretation is slightly misleading. Nonetheless, it is true that, similar to the bias-variance trade-off, manipulation of (the size of) $\\mathcal{A}$ is the key device to address the estimation-misspecification error trade-off. The minimal excess risk can be reached by the action space where the following two forces are balanced {REF to figure in notebook3}:\n",

    "The introduced notion of misspecification is a *statistical* one. From a modeller's point of view, a natural question to ask is to what extent misspecification affects the economic interpretation of the parameters of a fitted statistical model. Intuitively, a necessary condition for the sensibility of economic interpretation is to have a correctly specified statistical model. Because different economic models can give rise to the same statistical model, this condition is by no means sufficient. From this angle, a misspecified statistical model can easily invalidate any kind of economic interpretation of estimated parameters. This issue is more subtle and it would require an extensive treatment that we cannot deliver here, but it is worth keeping in mind the list of very strong assumptions that we are (implicitly) using when we give well-defined meaning to our parameter estimates.
